# rfid_project
This is my two-ESP32 access control system. One ESP32 handles the RFID reader, keypad, LEDs, buzzer, and authentication, while the second updates a 16×2 LCD over ESP-NOW. It checks an RFID card, asks for a PIN, and gives clear feedback. I built it primarily to learn how to coordinate multiple microcontrollers, but also see the applications of EE.
